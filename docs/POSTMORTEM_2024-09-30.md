# Postmortem: Agentic Workshop Incident - September 30, 2024

**Date:** September 30, 2024  
**Environment:** https://ai.coder.com  
**Severity:** High  
**Duration:** ~10 minutes into workshop until post-workshop fixes  
**Impact:** Multiple user workspaces died/restarted, wiping user progress during live workshop  

---

## Executive Summary

During the Agentic Workshop on September 30, the AI demo environment experienced multiple cascading failures when approximately 10+ users simultaneously onboarded and deployed workspaces. While initial deployments succeeded, resource contention and architectural issues caused workspace instability, data loss, and service disruptions across the multi-region infrastructure. The incident revealed gaps in stress testing and highlighted limitations in the current architecture that were not apparent during smaller-scale internal testing.

---

## Timeline

**Pre-incident:** Workshop begins, users start onboarding process  
**T+0 min:** Initial workspace deployments roll through successfully  
**T+~10 min:** Workspaces begin competing for resources as workloads start running  
**T+~10 min:** LiteLLM authentication key briefly expires (few seconds)  
**T+~10 min:** Workspaces start dying and restarting, triggering self-healing mechanisms  
**T+~10 min:** User progress wiped due to ephemeral volume issues  
**T+~10 min:** Subdomain routing issues surface between Oregon and London proxy clusters  
**Post-workshop:** Fixes applied to address all identified issues  

---

## Architecture Context

### Multi-Region Deployment

**Control Plane (us-east-2 - Ohio)**:
- Coder Server: 2 replicas @ 4 vCPU / 8 GB each
- External Provisioners: 6 replicas (default org) @ 500m CPU / 512 MB each
- LiteLLM Service: 4 replicas @ 2 vCPU / 4 GB each
- Primary domain: `ai.coder.com` + `*.ai.coder.com`

**Proxy Clusters**:
- Oregon (us-west-2): 2 replicas @ 500m CPU / 1 GB, domain: `oregon-proxy.ai.coder.com`
- London (eu-west-2): 2 replicas @ 500m CPU / 1 GB, domain: `emea-proxy.ai.coder.com`

**Image Management**:
- Source: `ghcr.io/coder/coder-preview` (non-GA preview for beta AI features)
- Mirrored to private AWS ECR (us-east-2)
- Critical dependency: ECR must stay in sync with GHCR

**DNS Management**:
- 6 domains managed in CloudFlare (control plane + 2 proxies, each with wildcard)
- Manual process via #help-me-ops Slack channel

---

## Root Causes

### 1. Resource Contention - Ephemeral Volume Storage

**Cause:** Limited node storage capacity for ephemeral volumes could not handle concurrent workspace workloads. Each workspace template consumes 2-4 vCPU and 4-8 GB memory, with ephemeral storage on node-local volumes.

**Impact:** Workspaces died and restarted when nodes exhausted storage, triggering self-healing that wiped user progress.

**Why it wasn't caught:** 
- No stress testing with realistic concurrent user load (10+ users)
- Internal testing used lower concurrency
- Capacity planning didn't account for simultaneous workspace workloads
- No monitoring/alerting for ephemeral volume storage thresholds

**Technical Details:**
- Workspace templates allow 2-4 vCPU / 4-8 GB configuration
- ~10 concurrent workspaces @ 4 vCPU / 8 GB = 40+ vCPU / 80+ GB demand
- Ephemeral volumes for each workspace competed for node storage
- Karpenter auto-scaled nodes but storage capacity per node remained fixed

### 2. Image Management Inconsistencies

**Cause:** The non-GA Coder preview image (`ghcr.io/coder/coder-preview`) mirrored to private ECR fell out of sync between the control plane (us-east-2) and proxy clusters (us-west-2, eu-west-2).

**Impact:** Image version mismatches caused subdomain routing failures across regions. Workspaces couldn't be accessed via proxy URLs (`*.oregon-proxy.ai.coder.com`, `*.emea-proxy.ai.coder.com`).

**Why it wasn't caught:** 
- Manual ECR mirroring process from GHCR is error-prone
- No automated validation of image digests across all clusters
- Issue only manifests under multi-region load with simultaneous deployments
- Pre-workshop checklist lacked image consistency verification

**Technical Details:**
- Image sync process:
  1. Pull from `ghcr.io/coder/coder-preview:latest`
  2. Tag and push to private ECR
  3. Deploy to all 3 regions (us-east-2, us-west-2, eu-west-2)
- During workshop, ECR mirror was stale
- Control plane ran newer image than proxies
- Subdomain routing logic failed due to version mismatch

### 3. LiteLLM Key Expiration

**Cause:** LiteLLM authentication key expired briefly during workshop. LiteLLM uses an auxiliary addon that rotates keys every 4-5 hours.

**Impact:** Brief service disruption (few seconds) for AI features (Claude Code CLI, Goose CLI). Key rotation also forces all workspaces to restart to consume new keys.

**Note:** Currently using open-source LiteLLM which has limited key management flexibility. Enterprise version not justified for current needs.

**Why it wasn't caught:**
- No pre-workshop validation of key expiration times
- Key rotation schedule not documented or considered in workshop planning
- No monitoring/alerting for upcoming key expirations

**Technical Details:**
- LiteLLM: 4 replicas @ 2 vCPU / 4 GB, round-robin between AWS Bedrock and GCP Vertex AI
- Auxiliary addon runs on 4-5 hour schedule
- Key rotation requires workspace restart to pick up new credentials
- If rotation occurs during workshop, causes mass workspace restarts

### 4. Provisioner Capacity Bottleneck

**Cause:** Default provisioner capacity (6 replicas @ 500m CPU / 512 MB) insufficient for ~10 concurrent users simultaneously creating workspaces.

**Impact:** Workspace create operations queued or timed out, causing delays and poor user experience.

**Why it wasn't caught:**
- No capacity planning guidelines for concurrent user scaling
- Provisioners are single-threaded (1 provisioner = 1 Terraform operation)
- No monitoring of provisioner queue depth
- Workshop planning didn't include provisioner pre-scaling

**Technical Details:**
- 10 users × 1 workspace each = 10 concurrent Terraform operations
- 6 provisioners = max 6 concurrent operations
- Remaining 4 operations queued, causing delays
- Recommendation: Scale to 8-10 replicas for 10-15 users

### 5. DNS Management Dependency

**Cause:** CloudFlare DNS managed manually via #help-me-ops Slack channel created potential for delays during incident response.

**Impact:** No immediate impact during workshop, but DNS issues would have been slow to resolve.

**Why it's a concern:**
- 6 domains to manage: control plane + 2 proxies (each with wildcard)
- No self-service for infrastructure team
- Dependency on ops team availability
- No automated validation of DNS configuration

## Impact Assessment

**Users Affected:** All workshop participants (~10+ concurrent users)  
**Data Loss:** User workspace progress wiped due to ephemeral volume restarts  
**Service Availability:** Degraded for ~10+ minutes during workshop  
**Business Impact:** Poor user experience during live demonstration/workshop event  

**Metrics**:
- Workspace failure rate: ~40-50% (estimated, 4-5 workspaces restarted)
- Average workspace restart time: 2-3 minutes
- Number of incidents: 3 major (storage, image sync, key expiration)
- User-visible impact duration: ~10 minutes

---

## What Went Well

- Initial deployment phase worked correctly (first ~10 minutes)
- Self-healing mechanisms activated (though resulted in data loss)
- Karpenter successfully scaled nodes in response to demand
- LiteLLM key rotation was brief (few seconds)
- Issues were contained to the workshop environment (no production impact)
- Team responded post-workshop with comprehensive fixes
- Base infrastructure foundation is solid (EKS, Karpenter, multi-region setup)
- Multi-region architecture design is sound

---

## What Went Wrong

- No internal stress testing with realistic concurrent user load prior to workshop
- Ephemeral volume capacity planning insufficient for simultaneous workloads
- Image management strategy across multi-region clusters not robust
- No pre-workshop validation of authentication keys or key rotation schedule
- Lack of monitoring/alerting for resource contention thresholds
- Provisioner capacity not scaled proactively
- No pre-workshop checklist or validation procedures
- Manual processes (ECR sync, CloudFlare DNS) created points of failure
- No capacity planning guidelines for concurrent user scaling

## Lessons Learned

### What We Learned

1. **Production-like testing is essential:** Internal testing without realistic concurrent load is insufficient for demo/workshop environments. The gap between "works in testing" and "works at scale" is significant.

2. **Capacity planning needs real-world data:** Architectural assumptions (storage, provisioners, LiteLLM) must be validated under actual user load patterns. Theoretical capacity ≠ practical capacity.

3. **Manual processes don't scale:** ECR image syncing and CloudFlare DNS management via Slack requests create bottlenecks and points of failure during incidents.

4. **Multi-region consistency is hard:** Keeping images, configurations, and services synchronized across us-east-2, us-west-2, and eu-west-2 requires automation and validation.

5. **Key rotation timing matters:** LiteLLM's 4-5 hour rotation schedule must be coordinated with workshop timing to avoid forced workspace restarts during events.

6. **Provisioner scaling is critical:** Single-threaded Terraform operations mean provisioner count directly determines concurrent workspace operation capacity.

7. **Pre-event validation is non-negotiable:** A structured checklist covering infrastructure, capacity, authentication, and routing prevents preventable issues.

8. **Monthly cadence provides continuous validation:** Regular workshops will surface optimization opportunities and prevent regressions. The base infrastructure is solid; now we need operational refinement.

### What We'll Do Differently

1. **Always run pre-workshop checklist** 2 days before events
2. **Scale provisioners and LiteLLM proactively** based on expected attendance
3. **Disable LiteLLM key rotation** during workshop windows
4. **Validate image consistency** across all regions before workshops
5. **Monitor ephemeral storage** and alert before capacity issues arise
6. **Automate manual processes** (ECR sync, DNS management)
7. **Conduct monthly workshops** to continuously stress test and improve
8. **Document everything** for faster incident response and knowledge sharing

### Process Improvements

1. **Pre-Workshop Checklist:** Mandatory 2-day pre-event validation covering all infrastructure components
2. **Incident Runbook:** Step-by-step procedures for common failure scenarios
3. **Capacity Planning:** Clear guidelines for scaling based on concurrent user count
4. **Monitoring Dashboard:** Real-time visibility during workshops for proactive issue detection
5. **Post-Workshop Retrospective:** Structured feedback loop to track improvements month-over-month
