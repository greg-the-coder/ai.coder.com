# Monthly Workshop Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the process for planning, executing, and following up on monthly Agentic Workshops for https://ai.coder.com.

## Purpose

Monthly workshops serve multiple objectives:

- **Stress Testing**: Validate platform stability under realistic concurrent user load
- **Continuous Improvement**: Surface optimization opportunities through real-world usage
- **User Feedback**: Gather insights from both internal and external users
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensure previous fixes remain stable and new features don't introduce issues

## Target Audience

- **Internal Users**: Coder employees testing new features and improvements
- **External Users**: Members of the coder-contrib GitHub organization
- **Target Concurrent Users**: 10-20+ simultaneous participants

## Workshop Schedule

**Cadence**: Monthly (first week of each month recommended)
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes
**Time**: Choose time that accommodates both US and international participants

## Pre-Workshop Checklist (T-7 days)

### 1. Scheduling & Communication

- [ ] Schedule workshop date/time (send calendar invite)
- [ ] Create registration form to track expected attendance
- [ ] Send announcement to internal team and coder-contrib organization
- [ ] Prepare workshop agenda and share with participants (T-3 days)
- [ ] Send reminder 24 hours before workshop

### 2. Infrastructure Validation (T-2 days)

Complete the [Pre-Workshop Validation Checklist](./PRE_WORKSHOP_CHECKLIST.md) which includes:

- [ ] LiteLLM authentication key validity (>7 days until expiration)
- [ ] Image consistency across all clusters (control plane, Oregon, London)
- [ ] Ephemeral volume storage capacity on all nodes
- [ ] Subdomain routing tests across all regions
- [ ] Resource limits and quotas verification
- [ ] Smoke tests in each region
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational check

### 3. Capacity Planning (T-2 days)

- [ ] Review registration count
- [ ] Calculate required resources based on expected concurrent users
- [ ] Verify storage capacity meets requirements (see Issue #1)
- [ ] Scale infrastructure if necessary (see scaling guidelines below)
- [ ] Document expected load for post-workshop analysis

#### Scaling Guidelines

**Provisioner Scaling** (Issue #8)

Provisioners handle Terraform operations for workspace create/delete/update. Each provisioner can handle 1 concurrent operation.

| Concurrent Users | Provisioner Replicas (Default Org) | Command |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| <10 | 6 (default, no change) | N/A |
| 10-15 | 8 replicas | `kubectl scale deployment coder-provisioner-default -n coder --replicas=8` |
| 15-20 | 10 replicas | `kubectl scale deployment coder-provisioner-default -n coder --replicas=10` |
| 20-30 | 12-15 replicas | `kubectl scale deployment coder-provisioner-default -n coder --replicas=12` |

**Current State**: 
- Default org: 6 replicas @ 500m CPU / 512 MB each
- Experimental org: 2 replicas
- Demo org: 2 replicas

**LiteLLM Scaling**

LiteLLM handles AI feature requests (Claude Code CLI, Goose CLI) via round-robin to AWS Bedrock and GCP Vertex.

| Concurrent Users | LiteLLM Replicas | Command |
|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| <20 | 4 (default, no change) | N/A |
| 20-30 | 6 replicas | `kubectl scale deployment litellm -n litellm --replicas=6` |
| 30+ | 8 replicas | `kubectl scale deployment litellm -n litellm --replicas=8` |

**Current State**: 4 replicas @ 2 vCPU / 4 GB each

**Workspace Resource Allocation**

Each workspace template allows users to select:
- **CPU**: 2-4 vCPU
- **Memory**: 4-8 GB
- **Storage**: Ephemeral volumes on node-local storage

**Example Capacity Calculation**:
- 15 concurrent users × 4 vCPU (average) = 60 vCPU total
- 15 concurrent users × 8 GB (average) = 120 GB total
- Verify Karpenter can scale to meet demand
- Ensure node storage capacity >60% headroom

**Karpenter Considerations**:
- Verify NodePools are healthy in all regions (us-east-2, us-west-2, eu-west-2)
- Check AWS EC2 instance quotas allow for expected node scaling
- Ensure sufficient EBS volume capacity for workspace storage

### 4. Content Preparation (T-3 days)

- [ ] Prepare workshop materials and exercises
- [ ] Test workshop content in isolated environment
- [ ] Prepare facilitator guide
- [ ] Set up real-time monitoring dashboard for workshop team

### 5. Pre-Workshop Scaling Actions (T-1 day)

**Complete 1 day before workshop to allow for validation**:

- [ ] **Scale provisioners** based on expected attendance (see scaling guidelines above)
  ```bash
  # Example for 15-20 users:
  kubectl scale deployment coder-provisioner-default -n coder --replicas=10
  
  # Verify scaling completed:
  kubectl get pods -n coder -l app=coder-provisioner -w
  ```

- [ ] **Scale LiteLLM** if expecting >20 users
  ```bash
  # Example for 20-30 users:
  kubectl scale deployment litellm -n litellm --replicas=6
  
  # Verify scaling completed:
  kubectl get pods -n litellm -l app=litellm -w
  ```

- [ ] **Disable LiteLLM key rotation** to prevent forced workspace restarts
  ```bash
  # Temporarily disable auxiliary addon key rotation
  kubectl scale deployment litellm-key-rotator -n litellm --replicas=0
  
  # IMPORTANT: Re-enable after workshop:
  # kubectl scale deployment litellm-key-rotator -n litellm --replicas=1
  ```

- [ ] **Verify Karpenter capacity**
  ```bash
  # Check current node count and capacity
  kubectl get nodes --show-labels | grep -E 'node.kubernetes.io/instance-type'
  
  # Verify AWS EC2 quotas allow for growth
  aws service-quotas get-service-quota --service-code ec2 --quota-code L-1216C47A --region us-east-2
  ```

- [ ] **Document scaling actions** in workshop notes for post-workshop scale-down
